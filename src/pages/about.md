## Project Story

The inspiration for this project came from worldmiao.two, a book aggregation search
engine rumoured to have been created by a few Peking University students. However,
several days after we heard about the site, it broke down. But it is really fancy and
make KevinZonda think about it day and night. Finally, KevinZonda understood that it's
his dream website. But it did not belong to him, more important, it was broken. Kevin
cries for days and the site still had no symptoms of recovering.
